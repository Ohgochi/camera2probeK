# camera2probeK
The original of this code is android-camera2probe by TobiasWeis.
https://github.com/TobiasWeis/android-camera2probe

I rewrote his code with the latest Java and the current Android API.
https://github.com/Ohgochi/camera2probe4

After that, I converted it to Kotlin.
If you have any suggestions, I would like to make use of them.
Thank you
