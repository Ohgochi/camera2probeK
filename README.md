The original of this code is android-camera2probe by TobiasWeis.

I tried to remake his code with modern Java and the current Android API.
There is little difference in its functionality.
In the future, I will try some extensions and create a Kotlin version.
But this was my first time using modern Java.
If you have any suggestions, I would like to make use of them.
Thank you
